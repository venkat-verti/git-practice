# Git Practice

This repo is for practicing git!

Please:

1. Fork this repo
2. Make two changes, in *two separate commits*, to test.py in branch called "Branch_1"

   **One of these changes must be the insertion of a new method between fizz_buzz and json_to_csv**
   
   It does not matter what these changes are or what the method does.
4. Once you have made the second commit, make another branch off of "Branch_1" called "Branch_2"

3. Create two pull requests against master:
    1. For the first, please squash down your two "Branch_1" commits.
    2. For the second, please first rebase "Branch_2" on upstream's 'trouble' branch and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
