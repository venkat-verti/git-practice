# Git Practice

This repo is for practicing git!

Please:

1. Fork this repo
2. Make two changes, in *two separate commits*, to `test.py` in a branch called "Branch_1"

   **One of these changes must be the insertion of a new method between fizz_buzz and json_to_csv**
   
   It does not matter what these changes are, or what the method does, but each change must introduce at least
   five new lines of code.
4. Once you have made the second commit, make another branch off of "Branch_1" called "Branch_2"

3. Create two pull requests against master:
    1. For the first, please first squash down your two "Branch_1" commits.
    2. For the second, please first rebase "Branch_2" on upstream's 'trouble' branch and resolve any conflicts that may arise. DO NOT squash your commits.
